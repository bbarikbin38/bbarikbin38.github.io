Welcome to my application.  

When starting to use the application, please copy the source files into your local machine.  I am seeing 404 issues 
when trying to access the files from github.io page.  

Please use the following commands to test the appication:
1) movie-this [insert movie title]
2) spotify-this track [insert track title]
3) concert-this [insert band/artist name]
4) The functionality for do-what-it-says is not 100% functional yet. 

Please note: I have been working to get the Spotify API keys to work from the .env file but have had a few issues.  I am working on updating this and will commit the change once resolved.
